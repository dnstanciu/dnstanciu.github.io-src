I am a PhD [student](http://www.anc.ed.ac.uk/dtc/?currentstudents=dragos-stanciu) at the University of Edinburgh and academic guest at the [Vision for Robotics Lab](http://www.v4rl.ethz.ch/the-group.html), ETH ZÃ¼rich.

My project involves employing neuromorphic chips such as the [Dynamic Vision Sensor](http://inilabs.com/products/dynamic-vision-sensors/) in the context of robot navigation.

You can check out my [CV]({filename}cv.md) or [GitHub]({filename}github.md) projects.
