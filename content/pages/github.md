#### MRes Project at University of Edinburgh

In the summer of 2014, I worked on my MRes in Neuroinformatics thesis at the University of Edinburgh. The project aimed to classify magnetoencephalography (MEG) recordings of subjects into one of three categories: Alzheimer's disease (AD), mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or healthy control (HC). Based on the correlations between pairs of MEG channels, one can compute "brain graphs" representing connectivity between different areas of the subject's brain. These graphs can then be used to extract a number of graph measures such as the clustering coefficient. Subsequently, the graph measures can be combined in feature vectors which can be used to train classifiers for predicting which of the three classes (AD, MCI or HC) a new MEG recording corresponds to.

#### National Data Science Bowl Plankton Classification Challenge

In February-March 2015, I participated in a [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/datasciencebowl) machine learning competition along six other PhD students. My focus was on developing an API for extracting computer vision features such as ORB from given images. These were later used to seek improvement in our classifiers. Our team, Neuroglycerin&trade;, placed in the top 5.4% of teams.

#### *Kalman and Bayesian Filters in Python* book pull request

While working through the book, I found a bug after upgrading some libraries. The patch can be found here (only the last commit is mine):
